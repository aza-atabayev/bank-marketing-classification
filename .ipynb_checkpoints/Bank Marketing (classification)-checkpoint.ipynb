    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "Some banking institutions use marketing campaigns to make clients subscribe to their services. One of those services is the term deposit, which restricts withdrawing the deposit until the term ends. This deposit allows a higher flexibility in budget management because it doesn't affect the \"liquidity coverage ratio\" (the amount of money that the bank has to be able to pay instantly). Therefore, predicting and identifying customers who are prone to subscribe to term deposits is beneficial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "The goal is to predict what type of customers will probably subscribe to term deposits by answering the following questions:\n",
    "* What kind of customers usually subscribe to term deposits?\n",
    "* By adjusting which marketing parameters banking insitution can increase chances of subscription?\n",
    "* What type of customers marketing team should focus on for their next marketing campaign?\n",
